# Nick Cave lyric database

Kind of foolish to start this a week before *Wild God*, but here I am. This template's scraper uses Genius API but as far as I'm concerned, any lyric website is a secondary source when Nick Cave publishes all NC&TBS and Grinderman himself (old man blogger ðŸ–¤) and we have *Nick Cave The Complete Lyrics 1978â€“2013* (Penguin Books, 2013). The lyrics in this dataset are all copy and pasted verbatim from [Nick Cave's official website](https://www.nickcave.com/lyrics/) as of 2024/08/22 besides these editorial choices:

- "There Is A Kingdom:" Added linebreak that looked missing between "Just like a birdâ€¨ / That sings up the sun"
- "Babe, I'm On Fire:" Replaced his "Chorus"'s with the chorus text, per *Nick Cave The Complete Lyrics 1978â€“2013* (Penguin Books, 2013).
- "Let the Bell Ring:" Replaced his "(Chorus)"'s with thie chorus tex, per *The Complete Lyrics*.
- "O Children:" Was missing spaces after each "Hey little train!"
- All of *Grinderman 2* except for "Palaces of Montezuma:" Removed double linebreaks.
- "Anthrocene:" Removed double linebreaks.
- "I Need You:" Removed double linebreaks.
- "Distant Sky:" [Does not currently have a lyric up](https://www.nickcave.com/lyric/distant-sky/), so this is transcribed.
- "Skeleton Tree:" Removed double linebreaks.
- All of *Carnage*: Removed double linebreaks.
- "Wild God": Removed double linebreaks, and I suspect will do for the rest of the album.

Additionally,

- I will not edit *DIG!!! LAZARUS DIG!!!* for legibility.
- "Hollywood" includes a four asterik ("****") divider because Nick does
- "White Elephant" includes a dedication "*For Thomas H*"
- AT SOME POINT: Will transcribe The Birthday Party lyrics from *Prayers on Fire*, *Junkyard*, *The Bad Seed*, *Burning the Ice*, and *Mutiny!* printed in *The Complete Lyrics*.
