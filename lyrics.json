    "Lyric": "I stepped into an avalanche\nIt covered up my soul\nWhen I am not this hunchback that you see\nI sleep beneath the golden hill\nYou, who wish to conquer pain\nYou, must learn, learn to serve me well\n\nYou strike my side by accident\nAs you go down to your goal\nThis cripple here that you clothe and feed\nIs neither starved nor cold\nHe does not ask for your company\nNot at the centre, the centre of the world\n\nAnd I am on a pedestal\nYou did not raise me there\nYour laws do not compel me now\nTo kneel grotesque and bare\nI, myself, am the pedestal\nFor this ugly hump at which you stare\n\nYou who wish to conquer pain\nYou must learn what makes me kind\nThe crumbs of love that you offer me\nAre the crumbs I’ve left behind\nYour pain is no credential here\nIt’s just a shadow of my wound\n\nI have begun to ask for you\nI, who have no greed\nI have begun to long for you\nI, who have no need\nYou say you’ve gone away from me\nBut I can feel you when you breathe\n\nDo not dress in those rags for me\nI know you are not poor\nAnd do not love me quite so fiercely now\nWhen you know that you are not sure\nIt is your turn, my beloved one\nIt is your flesh that I wear"

    "Lyric": "I am tall and I am thin\nOf an enviable height\nAnd I’ve been known to be quite handsome\nFrom a certain angle and in a certain light\nWell I entered into O’Malley’s\nSaid, “O’Malley I have a thirst”\nO’Malley merely smiled at me\nSaid “You wouldn’t be the first”\nI knocked on the bar and pointed\nTo a bottle on the shelf\nAnd as O’Malley poured me out a drink\nI sniffed and crossed myself\nMy hand decided that the time was nigh\nAnd for a moment it slipped from view\nAnd when it returned, it fairly burned\nWith confidence anew\nWell the thunder from my steely fist\nMade all the glasses jangle\nWhen I shot him, I was so handsome\nIt was the light, it was the angle\n\nHuh! Hmmmmm\n\n“Neighbours!” I cried, “Friends!” I screamed\nI banged my fist upon the bar\n“I bear no grudge against you!”\nAnd my dick felt long and hard\n“I am the man for which no God waits\nFor which the whole world yearns\nI’m marked by darkness and by blood\nAnd one thousand powder-burns”\nWell, you know those fish with the swollen lips\nThat clean the ocean floor?\nWhen I looked at poor O’Malley’s wife\nThat is exactly what I saw\nI jammed the barrel under her chin\nAnd her face looked raw and vicious\nHer head it landed in the sink\nWith all the dirty dishes\nHer little daughter Siobhan\nPulled beers from dusk till dawn\nAnd amongst the townfolk, she was a bit of a joke\nBut she pulled the best beers in town\nI swooped magnificent upon her\nAs she sat shivering in her grief\nLike the Madonna painted on the church-house wall\nIn whale’s blood and banana leaf\nHer throat it crumbled in my fist\nAnd I spun heroically around\nTo see Caffrey rising from his chair\nI shot that mother fucker down\n\nMmmmmmmmm Yeah Yeah Yeah\n\n“I have no free will,” I sang\nAs I flew about the murder\nMrs. Richard Holmes, she screamed\nYou really should have heard her\nI sang and I laughed, I howled and I wept\nI panted like a pup\nI blew a hole in Mrs. Richard Holmes\nAnd her husband he stood up\nAnd he screamed, “You are an evil man”\nAnd I paused a while to wonder\n“If I have no free will then how can I\nBe morally culpable, I wonder”\nI shot Richard Holmes in the stomach\nAnd gingerly he sat down\nAnd he whispered weirdly, “No offense”\nAnd lay upon the ground\n“None taken,” I replied to him\nWith which he gave a little cough\nWith blazing wings I neatly aimed\nAnd blew his head completely off\nI’ve lived in this town for thirty years\nAnd to no-one am I a stranger\nAnd I put new bullets in my gun\nChamber upon chamber\nAnd when I turned my gun on the bird-like Mr. Brookes\nI thought of Saint Francis and his sparrows\nAnd as I shot down the youthful Richardson\nIt was St. Sebastian I thought of, and his arrows\n\nHhhhhhhhhhhh Mmmmmmmmm\n\nI said, “I want to introduce myself\nAnd I am glad that you all came”\nAnd I leapt upon the bar\nAnd shouted out my name\nWell Jerry Bellows, he hugged his stool\nClosed his eyes and shrugged and laughed\nAnd with an ashtray as big as a fucking big brick\nI split his head in half\nHis blood spilled across the bar\nLike a steaming scarlet brook\nAnd I knelt at it’s edge on the counter\nWiped the tears away and looked\nWell, the light in there was blinding\nFull of God and ghosts and truth\nI smiled at Henry Davenport\nWho made an attempt to move\nWell, from the position I was standing\nThe strangest thing I ever saw\nThe bullet entered through the top of his chest\nAnd blew his bowels out on the floor\nWell I floated down the counter\nShowing no remorse\nI shot a hole in Kathleen Carpenter\nRecently divorced\nBut remorse I felt and remorse I had\nIt clung to every thing\nFrom the raven’s hair upon my head\nTo the feathers on my wings\nRemorse squeezed my hand in it’s fraudulent claw\nWith it’s golden hairless chest\nAnd I glided through the bodies\nAnd killed the fat man Vincent West\nWho sat quietly in his chair\nA man become a child\nAnd I raised the gun up to his head\nExecutioner-style\nHe made no attempt to resist\nSo fat and dull and lazy\n“Do you know I lived in your street?” I cried\nAnd he looked at me as though I were crazy\n“O”, he said, “I had no idea”\nAnd he grew as quiet as a mouse\nAnd the roar of the pistol when it went off\nNear blew the hat right off the house\n\nWell, I caught my eye in the mirror\nAnd gave it a long and loving inspection\n“There stands some kind of man”, I roared\nAnd there did, in the reflection\nMy hair combed back like a raven’s wing\nMy muscles hard and tight\nAnd curling from the business end of my gun\nWas a query-mark of cordite\nWell I spun to the left, I spun to the right\nAnd I spun to the left again\n“Fear me! Fear me!”\nBut no one did cause they were dead\n\nHuh! Hmmmmmmmm\n\nAnd then there were the police sirens wailing\nAnd a bull-horn squelched and blared\n“Drop your weapons and come out\nWith your hands held in the air”\nWell, I checked the chambers of my gun\nSaw I had one final bullet left\nMy hand, it looked almost human\nAs I held it to my head\n“Drop your weapon and come out!\nKeep your hands above your head!”\nWell, I had one long hard think about dying\nAnd did exactly what they said\nThere must have been fifty cops out there\nIn a circle around O’Malley’s bar\n“Don’t shoot”, I cried, “I’m a man unarmed!”\nSo they put me in their car\nAnd they sped me away from that terrible scene\nAnd I glanced out of the window\nSaw O’Malley’s bar, saw the cops and the cars\nAnd started counting on my fingers\n\nAaaaaaaaah One Aaaaaaaah Two Aaaaaah Three Aaaah Four\nO’Malley’s bar O’Malley’s bar"
