# Nick Cave lyric scraper

Kind of foolish to start this a week before *Wild God*, but here I am. These lyrics are all copy and pasted verbatim from [Nick Cave's official website](https://www.nickcave.com/lyrics/) as of 2024/08/22 besides these editorial choices:

- "There Is A Kingdom:" Added linebreak that looked missing between "Just like a birdâ€¨ / That sings up the sun"
- *Abattoir Blues / The Lyre Of Orpheus* are split into two albums.
- "O Children:" Was missing spaces after each "Hey little train!"
- All of *Grinderman 2* except for "Palaces of Montezuma:" Removed double linebreaks.
- "Anthrocene:" Removed double linebreaks.
- "I Need You:" Removed double linebreaks.
- "Skeleton Tree:" Removed double linebreaks.
- All of *Carnage*: Removed double linebreaks.
- "White Elephant": Removed "*For Thomas H*" from since it is not sung or spoken on the recording.
- "Wild God": Removed double linebreaks.

**Quirks**
- I refuse to edit *DIG!!! LAZARUS DIG!!!* for legibility/scrapabilty. He was on some poetic puncutation kick that I respect.
- He writes just "Chorus" or "(Chorus)" on "Babe, I'm On Fire", "Let The Bells Ring" so I might or might not replace those with the actual chorus text

## Changelog
