Accurate to Nick Cave's official website as of 240822 besides these editorializaitons:

- "There Is A Kingdom": First line was missing a linebreak
- He writes just "Chorus" or "(Chorus)" on "Babe, I'm On Fire", "Let The Bells
    Ring", so I replaced them with the actual chorus text.
- I split *Abattoir Blues / The Lyre Of Orpheus* into two albums.
- "O Children" was missing spaces after the exclamation points.
- I refuse to edit *DIG!!! LAZARUS DIG!!!*, where he uses ampersands instead of
    "and", uses "y" and "y/" and "yr", etc
- *Carnage*, "Anthrocene," "I Need You", "Skeleton Tree," and every song on *Grinderman 2* except "Palaces of Montezuma" have
    double linebreaks that I removed for the sake of file size.
- Removed "*For Thomas H*" from "White Elephant" since it is not sung or spoken
    on the recording.
