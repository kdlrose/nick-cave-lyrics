# Nick Cave lyric scraper

Accurate to Nick Cave's official website as of 22 Aug 2024 besides these editorial choices:

- "There Is A Kingdom": First line was missing a linebreak
- *Abattoir Blues / The Lyre Of Orpheus* are split into two albums.
- "O Children": Was missing spaces after the exclamation points.
- *Carnage*, "Anthrocene," "I Need You", "Skeleton Tree," and every song on *Grinderman 2* except "Palaces of Montezuma": Removed double linebreaks for .csv parsing.
- "White Elephant": Removed "*For Thomas H*" from since it is not sung or spoken on the recording.

**Quirks**
- I refuse to edit *DIG!!! LAZARUS DIG!!!* for legibility/scrapabilty. He was on some poetic puncutation kick that I respect.
- He writes just "Chorus" or "(Chorus)" on "Babe, I'm On Fire", "Let The Bells Ring" so I might or might not replace those with the actual chorus text

## Changelog

### 2024 Aug 22
- Created 'songs.csv' and 'song_titles.txt'.
