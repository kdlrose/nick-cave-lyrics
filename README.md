# Nick Cave lyric database

Lyrics Nick Cave has published for The Birthday Party, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Grinderman, and *Carnage* compiled from [his official website](https://www.nickcave.com/lyrics/) and *Nick Cave The Complete Lyrics 1978â€“2013* (Penguin Books, 2013).

The Bad Seeds and Grinderman lyrics are verbatim from his website, with exceptions:

- "There Is A Kingdom:" Added linebreak that looked missing between "Just like a birdâ€¨ / That sings up the sun"
- "Babe, I'm On Fire:" Replaced his "Chorus"'s with the chorus text.
- "Let the Bell Ring:" Replaced his "(Chorus)"'s with thie chorus text.
- "O Children:" Was missing spaces after each "Hey little train!"
- All of *Grinderman 2* except for "Palaces of Montezuma:" Removed double linebreaks.
- "Anthrocene:" Removed double linebreaks.
- "I Need You:" Removed double linebreaks.
- "Distant Sky:" [Does not currently have a lyric up](https://www.nickcave.com/lyric/distant-sky/), so this is transcribed.
- "Skeleton Tree:" Removed double linebreaks.
- All of *Carnage*: Removed double linebreaks.
- "Wild God": Removed double linebreaks, and I suspect will do for the rest of the album.

Not quite editorializations but other things to note:

- "Mutiny in Heaven:" Really looks best on a printed page. My indentations are a sorry approximation of the form he intended. Quite sculptural!
- "Hollywood:" Includes his four-asterisk divider.
- "White Elephant:" Includes his dedication to Thomas Houseago.
